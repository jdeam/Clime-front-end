# Clime-front-end

http://clime.surge.sh/

Used Node/Express and vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation methods to create a full-stack web application for aggregating weather forecast data for climbing areas around the US. Graphs rendered with Chart.js; site styled with Bulma CSS. Initial location data scraped from mountainproject.com with Puppeteer/Headless Chrome.

**Back end:** https://github.com/jdeam/Clime-back-end

**Technologies used:**

* Node.js
* Express
* Chart.js
* PostgreSQL database via Knex.js
* Moment.js (for forecast timestamps)
* Axios (for calls to Google Geocode/Dark Sky APIs)
