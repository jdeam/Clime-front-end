# Clime-front-end

Used Node/Express and vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation methods to create a full-stack web application for aggregating weather forecast data for climbing areas around the US. Graphs rendered with Chart.js; site styled with Bulma CSS. Initial location data scraped from mountainproject.com with Puppeteer/Headless Chrome.
